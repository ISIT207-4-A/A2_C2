        <p>To be, or not to be, that is the question:
            Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
            The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
            Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
            And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
            No more; and by a sleep to say we end
            The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
            That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
            Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
            To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:
            For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
            When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
            Must give us pause—there's the respect
            That makes calamity of so long life.    </p>
        </div>
    <div id="tabs-2" >
        <p>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
            Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
            The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
            The insolence of office, and the spurns
            That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,
            When he himself might his quietus make
            With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
            To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
            But that the dread of something after death,
            The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn
            No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
            And makes us rather bear those ills we have
            Than fly to others that we know not of?

    </div>
    <div id="tabs-3" >
        <p>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
            And thus the native hue of resolution
            Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
            And enterprises of great pitch and moment
            With this regard their currents turn awry
            And lose the name of action.</p>

            Foot it featly here and there;
            And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.

            Bow, wow.

        When that I was and a little tiny boy,
        With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
        A foolish thing was but a toy,
        For the rain it raineth every day.

        But when I came to man's estate,
        With hey, ho, . . .
        'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate
        For the rain, . . .

        But when I came, alas! to wive,
        With hey, ho, . . .
        By swaggering could I never thrive,
        For the rain, . . .

        But when I came unto my beds,
        With hey, ho, . . .
        With toss-pots still had drunken heads,
        For the rain, . . .

        A great while ago the world begun,
        With hey, ho, . . .
        But that's all one, our play is done.
        And we'll strive to please you every day.

    <div>   Hamlet, Act IV, Scene IV [How all occasions do inform against me]</div>

    <div>






        How all occasions do inform against me,
        And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
        If his chief good and market of his time
        Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
        Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
        Looking before and after, gave us not
        That capability and god-like reason
        To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
        Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
        Of thinking too precisely on the event,
        A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
        And ever three parts coward, I do not know
        Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
        Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
        To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
        Witness this army of such mass and charge
        Led by a delicate and tender prince,
        Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
        Makes mouths at the invisible event,
        Exposing what is mortal and unsure
        To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
        Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
        Is not to stir without great argument,
        But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
        When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
        That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
        Excitements of my reason and my blood,
        And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
        The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
        That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
        Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
        Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
        Which is not tomb enough and continent
        To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
        My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
